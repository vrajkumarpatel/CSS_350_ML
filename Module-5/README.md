# Module 5: Classification

## Overview
This module explores Classification, where the goal is to predict categorical labels. We apply these techniques to categorize different types of cuisines based on their ingredients.

## Key Topics
- **Multi-class Classification**: Handling problems with more than two target classes.
- **Feature Engineering**: Processing text or categorical data for model input.
- **Classifier Comparison**: Evaluating different classification algorithms.

## Files
- `Modul_5_Classifier_Student.ipynb`: The primary notebook for the classification assignment.
- `process_data.py`: Helper script for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- `cuisines.csv` & `cleaned_cuisines.csv`: Raw and processed datasets.
