# Module 3: Fairness in Machine Learning

## Overview
This module addresses one of the most critical aspects of modern AI: Fairness. We explore how bias can enter machine learning pipelines and methods to detect and mitigate it.

## Key Topics
- **Bias Detection**: Analyzing datasets and models for discriminatory patterns.
- **Fairness Metrics**: Using statistical tools to measure fairness.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Techniques to reduce bias in model predictions.

## Files
- **Fairness Analysis Report**: Detailed report on the findings regarding fairness in the chosen models.
- `fairness_analysis.ipynb`: The main notebook conducting the fairness audit.
- `adult/`: Directory containing the Adult dataset (Census Income) used for this analysis.
