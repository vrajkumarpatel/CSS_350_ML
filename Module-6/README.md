# Module 6: Clustering Analysis

## Overview
Module 6 introduces Unsupervised Learning through Clustering. Unlike supervised learning, we work with unlabeled data to find hidden structures and patterns.

## Key Topics
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Implementing K-Means or similar algorithms.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to visualize high-dimensional data.
- **Music Analysis**: analyzing features of songs to group them into clusters.

## Files
- `Module_6_clustering_Student.ipynb`: Notebook for performing clustering analysis.
- `nigerian-songs.csv`: Dataset of songs used for clustering.
