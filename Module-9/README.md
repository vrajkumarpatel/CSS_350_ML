# Module 9: Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
The final module introduces Reinforcement Learning (RL), where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize a reward.

## Key Topics
- **Agents and Environments**: Understanding the RL loop.
- **Q-Learning / Policy**: Basic concepts of how agents learn strategies.
- **Simulation**: Using a grid-based board to simulate agent interactions.

## Files
- `Module_9_Assignment.ipynb`: Notebook demonstrating the RL concepts.
- `rlboard.py`: Helper script defining the reinforcement learning environment.
- `wolf.png`, `apple.png`, `human.png`: Assets for the visual representation of the environment.
