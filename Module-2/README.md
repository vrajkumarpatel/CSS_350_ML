# Module 2: Supervised Learning

## Overview
Module 2 dives into the core concepts of supervised learning. The focus is on understanding how models learn from labeled data to make predictions.

## Key Topics
- **Optimization**: Implementation of custom optimizers to understand the underlying mechanics of model training.
- **Data Analysis**: Working with the Seattle Weather dataset to predict weather patterns.

## Files
- `Module_2_Supervised_learning_test_model_Student.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for testing and experimenting with supervised learning models.
- `m0b_optimizer.py`: Python script containing the implementation of the optimizer.
- `seattleWeather_1948-2017.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis.
